## Medium Risk

### [M-01] Users who deposit via `returnShares()` can be unable to withdraw

**Severity**

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

**Description**

The problem is that functions `gimmieShares()` and `returnShares()` don't update the array of vaults `stakersVaults`.
For example, if the user's first deposit was made via `returnShares`, the vault won't be added to the user's vault array. As a result, withdrawal will revert when trying to remove that vault:

```solidity
    function removeShares(address staker, IVault vault, uint256 shares)
        external
        onlyDelegationSupervisor
        onlyChildVault(vault)
        nonReentrant
    {
        ...
        if (userShares == 0) {
            removeVaultFromStaker(staker, vault);
        }
    }
```

The issue can be mitigated by calling `gimmieShares()` to transfer all the shares and then calling normal `deposit`, however, this scenario is not properly documented and is not applicable in immutable integrator contracts.

**Recommendations**

```diff
    function gimmieShares(IVault vault, uint256 shares) public onlyChildVault(vault) nonReentrant {
+       require(shares != 0);
        IERC20 shareToken = IERC20(vault);

        VaultSupervisorLib.Storage storage self = _self();
        // Verify the user is the owner of these shares
        if (self.stakerShares[msg.sender][vault] < shares) revert NotEnoughShares();

        self.stakerShares[msg.sender][vault] -= shares;
+       if (userShares == 0) {
+           removeVaultFromStaker(staker, vault);
+       }

        shareToken.transfer(msg.sender, shares);
    }

    function returnShares(IVault vault, uint256 shares) external onlyChildVault(vault) nonReentrant {
        IERC20 shareToken = IERC20(vault);

        VaultSupervisorLib.Storage storage self = _self();
+
+       require(shares != 0);
+       if (self.stakerShares[staker][vault] == 0) {
+           if (self.stakersVaults[staker].length >= Constants.MAX_VAULTS_PER_STAKER) revert MaxStakerVault();
+           self.stakersVaults[staker].push(vault);
+       }

        self.stakerShares[msg.sender][vault] += shares;

        shareToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), shares);
    }
```

### [M-02] First depositor attack is possible

**Severity**

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

**Description**

It is a classic attack with the following flow:

1. The user is the first to interact with the vault, he sends a deposit transaction.
2. Attacker frontruns user's tx by performing 2 actions: 1) deposit 1 wei asset thus minting 1 wei share; 2) donate a big amount of asset to the vault.
3. User's transaction executes and the user mints 0 shares because of rounding in a formula that is used inside ERC4626: `shares = assets * sharesSupply / totalAssets`. That is because `sharesSupply` is 1 and `totalAssets` is large due to donation.
4. Then the attacker withdraws donated assets plus the user's deposit.

However, Karak-restaking uses Solady's ERC4626 implementation which makes the attack less profitable and harder to perform. By default it uses a different formula: in calculations of `shares` and `assets` it adds an extra 1.
As a result, the attack is profitable in case there are 2 or more first deposits of approximately near size in mempool. Worth mentioning that vaults are the core mechanic of protocol, there will be multiple chances to perform the attack.

**Recommendations**

There are 2 possible mitigations:

1. Override function `_decimalsOffset()` in Vault.sol. It will increase the decimals of Vault.
2. Create "dead shares" like it's done in UniswapV2, i.e. deposit the initial amount to the vault on the initialization step.

## Low Risk

### [L-01] Withdrawals may encounter OOG as there is no max limit for list length

Users have to call `startWithdraw()` and then call `finishWithdraw()` to withdraw their funds from the system. When users call the withdraw function they specify a list of vaults they want to withdraw from, the issue is that the logic inside `finishWithdraw()` is more complex and would consume more gas. There may be scenarios that user calls to `startWithdraw()` executes but later users won't be able to call `finishWithdraw()` because of OOG. The list of vaults the user specifies may have duplicate items too, so the list can have more items than `MAX_VAULTS_PER_STAKER`.

### [L-02] Centralization risk as the withdrawals can be paused

Users have to call `startWithdraw()` and `finishWithdraw()` to withdraw their funds but the issue is that those functions would revert when a contract is paused so there is a centralization risk that the user won't be able to access their funds and withdraw them if protocol admin was compromised.

### [L-03] Contract Vault doesn't override the `maxMint()` function

In the contract Vault, there is `assetLimit` to make sure that Vault won't receive more than that amount of assets. Function `deposit()` checks this limit but function `mint()` has no such check so it would be possible to bypass that limit by using function `mint()`.

Also, the code doesn't override the function `maxMint()` and even so function `maxDeposit()` exists in Vault code and returns the correct value based on `assetLimit` but function `maxMint()` doesn't exists in Vault and it would return `uint(256).max` which is set in the Solady library. This is against ERC4626 standard as values return by `maxMint()` and `maxDeposit()` don't match.

Add function `maxMint()` and also add `assetLimit` check to function `mint()`.
