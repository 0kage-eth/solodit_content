### [L-01] Multiple cooldowns are not managed for the same user

When `unstake()` a given user updates their `cooldownStartTimestamp`.

```solidity
...
StakeData storage stakeData = stakes[msg.sender][token];
...
stakeData.cooldownStartTimestamp = uint104(block.timestamp);
```

It means different unstakes by the user will not go in parallel - only the last unstake will accumulate all previous pending unstakes and can be withdrawn on `last unstake time + stakeParameters.cooldown`.
It is also relevant for those unstakes that waited for enough `cooldown` and are ready to withdraw - such unstakes will wait for a new `cooldown` if some new unstake is called.

If this behavior is not desired, consider managing a separate queue for unstakes and withdrawals, where every unstake has its own storage.
