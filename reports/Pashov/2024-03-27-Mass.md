## Low Risk

### [L-01] Immutable Aave pool address

According to the Aave docs, the address of the Aave pool should be fetched from the pool address provider contract. The address of the pool address provider is never expected to be changed and is thus immutable. The suggestions can be found [here](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pooladdressesprovider#pooladdressesprovider) in the docs.

Instead of saving the pool address in an immutable variable in the FlashloanerMSA.sol contract, consider instead saving the pool address provider contract address and calling `getAddress()` function to get the address of the pool

### [L-02] Missing `msg.value` check in some functions

Some functions in the `MassSmartAccount.sol` contract are missing the check that `msg.value == value`. This check is required in functions where users can send eth when calling the function and makes sure that the user doesn't end up sending extra eth than they specified, leading to them leaving that eth in the account.

This issue is present in the functions `executeCall`, `executeHyVMCall` and `performReentrantCall`. The other functions handling eth have this check but not these few. Consider adding this check to those functions.
