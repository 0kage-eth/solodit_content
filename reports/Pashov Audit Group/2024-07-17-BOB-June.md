## Medium Risk
### [M-01] Gas Price can change, making `sigFees` calculation insufficient

**Severity**

**Impact:** Medium

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Description**

When a user asks for a redemption, the validators submit signatures which eventually transfer out the bitcoin ordinal. To compensate the validator's gas fees, the user is required to pay for them.

```solidity
uint256 sigFees = BTC_SIG_GAS_USAGE * tx.gasprice * uint256(multisig.activeCommitteeSize);
```

This `sigFees` is meant to cover the gas cost of the validators, which is incurred by them when they post a multisig signature. The issue is that this function uses `tx.gasPrice`. This is a user controlled argument, and heavily depends on the network traffic.

Say Alice wants to redeem her ordinal. She calls `redeem` during a time of low network traffic, so she sets her `tx.gasPrice` as 0.1 gwei. When the validators are required to submit the signatures, the gas price might have shot up due to higher network traffic. The validators are then forced to use a higher gas price, say 0.2 gwei to get their transaction through.

Since only 0.1 gwei priced gas fees were set aside, the validator will simply refuse to do the transaction.

This is not Alice's fault, since she probably did the transaction with a wallet that guesses the optimum gas price to set for the current block. If Alice wants to make sure her redemption goes through, she needs to manually set her `tx.gasPrice` higher, anticipating future higher network usage. However, this causes her to waste gas, since she is now bidding at a much higher gas price for the current transaction, which doesn't need it.

In addition, it is possible to avoid paying fees by setting zero gas prices.

**Recommendation**

Consider allowing ALICE to specify how much eth she wants to allocate to the validators to cover gas fees, and then reimburse the rest to her after the redemption is over.

## Low Risk
### [L-01] multisigHash should have an expiration deadline

Currently, `multisigHash` statements do not have an expiry date. This poses some risks in case of lowering the `threshold` variable or some validators going malicious at some point in time which may cause some previously malicious `multisigHash` to suddenly be approved.

## Low Risk
### [L-02] Setting max amount of `msg.value` for redeem/mint fees

`msg.value` can be accepted to top up `redeemFees` and `mintFees`.
But it can be any number even if it is far above the required amount.
Consider comparing with some max allowed required amount that would make sense.

## Low Risk
### [L-03] Hardcoded `BTC_SIG_GAS_USAGE` can brick the bridge in case of a network upgrade

The function `_remFees` in `Bridge.sol` contract deducts gas fees for the validators. It calculates this assuming a fixed cost for submitting the bitcoin signature.

```solidity
uint256 private constant BTC_SIG_GAS_USAGE = 33704;
uint256 sigFees = BTC_SIG_GAS_USAGE * tx.gasprice * uint256(multisig.activeCommitteeSize);
```

However, due to a network upgrade, gas fees for different operations like store, read etc can change. If the fee for submitting a bitcoin signature changes, then the `sigFees` calculated will be off, since `BTC_SIG_GAS_USAGE` is defined as a constant and cannot be changed. This would require a re-deployment of the bridge.

Consider allowing `BTC_SIG_GAS_USAGE` to be changeable.
