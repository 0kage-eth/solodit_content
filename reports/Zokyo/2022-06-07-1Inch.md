# Findings

## High Risk

### Deprecated ETH transfer.
**Description**

LimitOrder ProtocolRFQ.sol: function fillOrderRFQTo(), line 165.

Due to the Istanbul update there were several changes provided to the EVM, which made .transfer() and .send() methods deprecated for the ETH transfer. Thus it is highly recommended to use .call() functionality with mandatory result check, or the built-in functionality of the Address contract from OpenZeppelin library.

**Recommendation**

Correct ETH sending functionality.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved

## Medium Risk

### Performance of swap can be blocked.
**Description**

GenericRouter.sol: function_swap(), line 165.

In case, there are unspent source tokens after swap, unspent amount is subtracted from spentAmount. In case a malicious actor transfers some amount of source tokens to contract, which would be greater than spentAmount of swap, subtraction will underflow, reverting transaction.

**Recommendation**

Correct ETH sending functionality.

**Re-audit comment**

Unresolved.
