# Findings

## High Risk

### NFT withdrawal vulnerability in MarinateV2.sol.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - withdraw Multiplier & stake Multipler, marinator stakes NFT with tokenld $=x$ while another marinator stakes tokenld = yof same NFT. The former marinator is able to withdraw the tokenId=y. NFT tokenlds are not holding same value, therefore that leads to loss of funds for some stakers.

**Recommendation**

Keep track of token Ids of NFTs

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - Partner removed parts related to NFTs.

### Flaw in tokenomical model due to `setScale` in MarinateV2.sol.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - function setScale causes a flaw in the tokenomical model. SCALE value affects quantities like totalToken RewardsPerStake. Changing SCALE using setScale does not update the quantities that were precalculated, hence this leads to a miscalculation when you execute that line after changing SCALE to a new value

uint256 owedPerUnitStake = totalToken RewardsPerStake[token][user];

uint256 totalRewards = (info.multipliedAmount * owedPerUnitStake) / SCALE;

This is limited to be called by admin though so as long as admin does not call it, issue is not having an effect on the project.

**Recommendation**

refer to the tokenomics of the project and recall what does SCALE value affect to update these values when you're setting SCALE to a new value in the body of this method.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - SCALEnow is immutable, setScaleis removed.

### Issues with token transfers and rewards when a marinator is removed from whitelist in MarinateV2.sol.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - the implementation of hooks_beforeTokenTransfer & _afterToken Transfer leads to issues in specific scenarios in which a marinator (i.e. contract holding mUMAMIS) is being dropped out of the whitelist. The issue is described in the following scenario, shown also in Proof of Concept (POC) tests.
Contract A & B are both whitelisted, so they stake their UMAMI
Contract A is no longer whitelisted
Contract A sends the mUMAMI to B and in the process B collects rewards while A does not
Contract B unstakes all mUMAMI and collects rewards
MarinateV2 is possessing a quantity of uncollectible rewards
The rewards are never claimed for Contract A even if it comes back to the white list
Also in this context the total Multiplied Staked does not hold the expected value proportional to the totalSupply of MarinateV2 since the value it holds at the end of this scenario will actually lead to unallocated funds when new rewards are added since total Token RewardsPerStakeis not fairly distributed.

**Recommendation**

declare a storage map for unallocated Rewards which going to receive rewards in this case and allocate them to totalToken RewardsPerStake.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - Transfers now are only allowed when both parties are whitelisted. Also, rewards are sent to the marinator before it is removed from whitelist.

### `migrateToken` in MarinateV2.sol does not update `totalTokenRewardsPerStake`.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - migrate Token transfers reward tokens to another address and does not update the value of total Token RewardsPerStake accordingly, which shall in turn cause loss of funds to some stakers trying to collect rewards.

**Recommendation**

Ensure `totalTokenRewardsPerStake` is updated correctly when `migrateToken` is called to prevent loss of funds for stakers.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - Partner removed migrate Token

### `isContract` implementation in ContractWhitelist.sol can be bypassed.
**Description**

ContractWhitelist.sol - unfortunately, the implementation of isContract can be surpassed by an attacker as contract does not show up the containment of code during constructor call. In the PoC tests, ImpersonatorFactory does just that: a factory of contracts (Imperso

**Recommendation**

f the attacker could not be discovered during stake, s/he can be discovered in other entrypoints like addToContractWhitelist or withdraw. In that sense, if a contract is discovered to have staked tokens without being added to the whitelist (and not removed priorly by admin) then the suitable measure might be taken to deincentivize that.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - Resolve attempt done by partner but in a way that introduced a limitation on operation. Investors cannot use Multisig. The Impersonator issue though is solved and this attack is now mitigated.

## Medium Risk

### `isEligibleSender` in ContractWhitelist.sol blocks multisig wallets.
**Description**

ContractWhitelist.sol - isEligibleSender which is a modifier applied to limit access on stake is now blocking multisig wallets due to tx.origin == msg.sender.

**Recommendation**

Modify `isEligibleSender` to allow multisig wallets or clearly document this limitation.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#2 - Partner made it clear that by design their intention is to be aware and whitelist contracts including multisigs.

### `removeApprovedRewardToken` in MarinateV2.sol may fail with small uncollectible residues.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - Regarding removeApproved Reward Token, require(IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) $==0$, "Reward token not completely claimed by everyone yet"). New issue is introduced: having balance required to be strictly equal to zero make it exposed to a scenario in which reward tokens with small uncollectible residues are not possible to be removed. A scenario is reproduced in a Proof of Concept test.

**Recommendation**

will be to adjust numbers, in terms of tokenomics of the project, in a way to deal with this or make sure the last staker collecting reward is actually collecting everything by rounding up the division in certain occasions rather than rounding down each time.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#2 - removeApproved Reward Token(), the method has been removed

### MarinateV2.sol may hold unrecoverable balances after token/NFT removal.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - removeApproved Reward Token & removeApproved Multiplier Token, MarinateV2 still holds balances of NFTs and reward tokens after removal and can not be dealt with using normal circumstances.

**Recommendation**

better off having a require statement that checks MarinateV2 does not have balance of those assets before removing them from their respective lists.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - NFT logic in the contract is already removed, hence removeApproved Multiplier Token issue is no longer relevant. Regarding removeApproved Reward Token, partner added a check on the reward token balance of the contract to ensure there are no residuals left: require (IERC20 (token).balanceOf(address(this)) $==0$, "Reward token not completely claimed by everyone yet"). Hence token will not be removed from list of reward tokens while there exist a balance of it.

### Lack of input validation for new values in MarinateV2.sol setters.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - addApproved Multiplier Token, setScale & setDepositLevel: new values are not validated before setting. For instance, there's no upper nor lower limit for mulptiplierthat is set in addApproved Multiplier Token.

**Recommendation**

Add appropriate validation (e.g., upper/lower limits) for new values in `addApprovedMultiplierToken`, `setScale`, and `setDepositLevel`.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - NFT logic and setScale are removed, hence first two issues are no longer relevant. body of setDepositLimit is unchanged hence issue persists partially only for that case.
fix#2 - partner added a check on deposit limit
require(limit < IERC20(UMAMI).totalSupply(), "Deposit limit cannot be greater than totalSupply");

### `onlyAdmin` guard on private function `_addRewards` in MarinateReceiver.sol.
**Description**

MarinateReceiver.sol - onlyAdminguard applied on private function _addRewards. This causes an issue for sendBalancesAsRewardsthat is supposed to be callable by admin and bots (automation) as it will only make it callable by admin and block automation calls.

**Recommendation**

no point of applying that guard in this context since the function is private already.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 onlyAdminguard is removed.

### `migrateToken` in MarinateV2.sol allows admin to withdraw funds, potentially concerning community.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - migrate Token(), Too much for admin, might be lured into it if $s/he$ is a single wallet having this kind of control. Also, the community might be concerned over this act of withdrawing funds.

**Recommendation**

add multisig

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 function is removed

## Low Risk

### Unchecked return values of `add` and `remove` from EnumerableSet.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol & Marinate Reciever.sol - unchecked return values:

• MarinateV2.constructor: reward Tokens.add(_UMAMI)

• MarinateV2.addApproved Reward Token: reward Tokens.add(token)

• MarinateV2.removeApproved Reward Token: reward Tokens.remove(token)

• MarinateReceiver.addDistributed Token: distributed Tokens.add(token)

• MarinateReceiver.removeDistributed Token: distributed Tokens.remove(token)

**Recommendation**

wrap in require statements

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved

### Potential for high gas consumption in token removal functions due to loop.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol & MarinateReciever.sol - removeApproved Reward Token, removeApproved Multiplier Token & remove Distributed Token - for loop might incur too much computation that goes above limit if list is too long. It can be avoided by utilizing a better data structure for this purpose.

**Recommendation**

Checkout enumerables by openzeppelin https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#EnumerableSet

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 - NFT logic is omitted, hence removeApproved Multiplier Tokenissue is no longer relevant. Regarding the other two functions, partner utilized the enumerables in the contracts.

## Informational

### Floating pragma versions.
**Description**

ALL contracts, Lock the pragma to a specific version, since not all the EVM compiler versions support all the features, especially the latest one's which are kind of beta versions, So the intended behavior written in code might not be executed as expected. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler, which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.

**Recommendation**

fix version to 0.8.4

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 solidity version is locked to 0.8.4 for the 3 contracts in scope

### Checks-effects-interactions pattern in `_stakeMultiplier`.
**Description**

MarinateV2.sol - follow checks-effects-interactions pattern in implementation of _stake Multiplier.

**Recommendation**

Watchout for the transfer nft interaction.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

fix#1 since NFT logic is omitted, this issue is no longer relevant.
