# Findings

## High Risk

### The auction account may be closed before the NFT is transferred to the winner
**Description**

If the user does not pay fees with a single transaction, but, for example, pays a fee via a separate transaction and calls the finalize method separately, all lamports from the auction account will be transferred. After the transfer, no lamports will remain on the auction account and the auction account will be closed. Once the auction account is closed, it becomes impossible to call the finalize method (the auction account in this case will be uninitialized), and, therefore, the winner will be left without an NFT. The isue is marked as High since it is directly connected to the funds flow.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/pay_seller_fee.rs
Line. 40.

**Recommendation**

Merge two instructions 'pay_seller_fee' and 'close_auction' to make it impossible to execute them separately.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
The team of auditors has checked the business logic update and reflected that on the schemeafter the fix.

## Medium Risk

### The fee may be changed during the auction.
**Description**

The platform owner can change the fee of the platform at any time without any restrictions at any moment during the existence of the auction. As a result, if this functionality is used in bad faith, you can change the fee of the auction by 100% and leave the creator of the auction with nothing.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/change_fee.rs

**Recommendation**

Make the platform fee not changeable by the auction platform owner after the auction is created.

### Potentially incorrect check in `cancel_auction`.
**Description**

During the testing stage, the team of auditors got failing conditions after the bid was placed. The team needs clarification in determining whether the statement condition is correct. Presumably, the passed bidders_wallet parameter should correspond to the bidder account, but the actual owner of the account is the System Program. Thus, the condition will always be false because the public keys of the System Program and the bidder will always differ. In this regard, if the state of the auction is in the Bidded state, it will be impossible to cancel the auction.
Line. 78, programs/auction_house/src/methods/cancel_auction.rs, function 'handle'
The issue is marked as Medium since there is a chance to disable the Cancel functionality (though it makes no threat for user's money).

**Recommendation**

We need verification from the Onemind team that this is the correct business logic. Review and clarify if the 'ctx.accounts.bidders_wallet.owner.key() != bidder' condition should be changed to 'ctx.accounts.bidders_wallet.key() != bidder'.

### Incorrect CPI and transfer call sequence in `cancel_auction`.
**Description**

During the testing phase, the team discovered an issue with the cancellation of the auction where the bid was placed. We received a runtime error "UnbalancedInstruction". It occurred because there is a transfer of lamports before all Cross-Program Invocations are finished. In this regard, the seller is deprived of the opportunity to cancel the auction, which has already made a bid.
Line. 75-92, programs/auction_house/src/methods/cancel_auction.rs, function 'handle'

**Recommendation**

Swap out the call to the close_account function and the 'if' block.

## Low Risk

### There is no time check when making a bid.
**Description**

In the auction configuration, the team of auditors set the start and end time of the auction, but when the user makes a bid, there is no time check, therefore, it does not matter when it starts.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/make_bid.rs

**Recommendation**

The team of auditors needs verification from the Onemind team that this is the correct business logic and that there is no need of time checking.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From the client:
Onemind team stated that they don't want to limit that functionality. If the user wants to create an auction starting in the past, Onemind don't want to prevent them from doing that. In the future, more distinct logic can be put on the web2 layer, but it's not necessary to limit that on the contract layer.

Post-audit.
The issue was verified by the client. Zokyo Security concluded that such functionality has no negative effect on the program.

### Incorrect fees calculation in `ChangeFee`.
**Description**

'ChangeFee' functionality does not have validation of passed values. Actually, the 'house_fee_basis_points' variable could have the value much more than '10000', which means that the changed fee could be up to 655% ('u16::MAX').
programs/auction_house/src/methods/change_fee.rs

**Recommendation**

Create a validation that 'house_fee_basis_points' cannot be more than '10000'.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit.
It was established that 'house_fee_basis_points' is also set during the initialization of the auction and there is no validation for the passed values there. The problem was resolved in another issue.

### Auction account not closed after `cancel_auction` without bids.
**Description**

After the cancel_auction method call (in case there is no bid yet), the 'auction' account is not closed.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/cancel_auction.rs, function 'handle'

**Recommendation**

The "auction" account should be closed.

## Informational

### Use of 3rd party library in Factory contract.
**Description**

In the Factory contract, all except init and update of the contract are using third-party lib, which is out of scope.
programs/nft_factory

**Recommendation**

We need verification from the Onemind team that out-of-scope libs can be trusted.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:
The only lib contracts are using is the common library for token and metaplex helpers - included in the git repository under 'libraries/common and attached to both contracts in Cargo.toml.

Post-audit.
The 3rd-party code has been verified by the client.

### Price transferred in Dutch auction is calculated price, not bid amount.
**Description**

In the Auction House contract, in a Dutch auction, if the user places a bid, then the current calculated price is transferred, not their bid.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/make_bid.rs

**Recommendation**

We need verification from the Onemind team that this is the correct business logic.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:
That is intended. The calculation of the price is based on the Dutch bid. We only take enough funds to cover the need for the Dutch bid at the given point of time.

Post-audit.
The functionality has been verified by the client.

### Missing check for `house_fee_basis_points` during auction initialization.
**Description**

During the initialization of the auction, as it was said in the postaudit for low-2, there is no check for the passed 'house_fee_basis_points' variable.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/initialize.rs
Line. 35.

**Recommendation**

Create a validation that 'house_fee_basis_points' cannot be more than '10000'.

### Potentially invalid funds recipient when closing auction account.
**Description**

Potentially invalid recipient of funds from closing the auction account. In the Auction House contract, at the time of closing the auction, the close_account function specifies 'payer' as the destination account. Probably, the seller's account should be specified here.
programs/auction_house/src/methods/close_auction.rs
Line. 79.

**Recommendation**

We need verification from the Onemind team that this is the correct business logic.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

From the client:
The Client marked this as a valid issue, but by the time of reporting, it was already resolved by the Onemind team. The team changed it to send the assets back to the seller instead of the payer.

Post-audit.
The team of auditors has verified the provided update.

### Unused 'Finished' auction state.
**Description**

Unused auction state. In the enum 'AuctionState', the 'Finished' field isn't used anywhere further.
programs/auction_house/src/auction.rs
Line. 78.

**Recommendation**

The 'Finished' auction state should be used further or removed.

### Unfinished functionality in commented code.
**Description**

Commented functionality that isn't currently implemented.
programs/auction_house/src/lib.rs
Line. 65-94.

**Recommendation**

The functionality must be implemented or comments must be removed.

### Typos in code comments/names.
**Description**

Typos may confuse the user. The 'royalities' field has bad naming.
programs/nft_factory/src/lib.rs
Line. 28.

**Recommendation**

'royalities' should be replaced with 'royalties'.
