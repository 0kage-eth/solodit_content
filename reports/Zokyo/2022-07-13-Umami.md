# Findings

## High Risk

### Uniswap V3 swap in `commitAndClose` susceptible to sandwich attack
**Description**

TracerGMXVault.sol - In body of swapToStable(...), call stack starts from external function commitAndClose(). This transaction can be spotted in pool and exposed to sandwich attack because of this snippet:

ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
 path: route,

});

recipient: address(this),

deadline: block.timestamp,

amountIn: wethBalance,

amountOutMinimum: 0

return router.exactInput(params)

setting amountOutMinimum to zero give a chance to the attacker to exploit that. Severity of this explained by uniswap's official docs

https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/guides/swaps/single-swaps

amountOutMinimum: we are setting to zero, but this is a significant risk in production. For a real deployment, this value should be calculated using our SDK or an onchain price oracle this helps protect against getting an unusually bad price for a trade due to a front running sandwich or another type of price manipulation

**Recommendation**

When trading from a smart contract, the most important thing to keep in mind is that access to an external price source is required. Without this, trades can be frontrun for considerable loss.

### Incorrect `pricePerShare` calculation on zero totalSupply
**Description**

ShareMath.sol - In body of pricePerShare (...), initial case on zero totalSupply  pps` is initiated to $10^{**}$ decimals where decimals refer to vault ERC20 decimals not the asset decimal.

uint256 singleShare $=10^{**}$ decimals;

return totalSupply > 0 ? single Share.mul(totalBalance).div (totalSupply): singleShare;

Example how this function is used

roundPricePerShare[_vaultRound] = ShareMath.pricePerShare(

);

totalSupply(),

IERC20(_vaultParams.asset).balanceOf(address(this)),

_vaultParams.decimals

_vaultParams.decimals refer to vault's decimals which messes up the calculation. This works inconsistently since in a case where asset is, for instance, usdc (decimals $=6$) and vault decimals $=18$ this will end up having pricePerShare in 18 decimals.

**Recommendation**

Ensure the `pricePerShare` calculation uses decimals consistent with the asset rather than the vault's ERC20 decimals to prevent miscalculation.

## Medium Risk

### Unhandled return value of `approve` function in `TracerGMXVault.sol`
**Description**

TracerGMXVault.sol - There are multiple calls to the approve function form the IERC20, because the ERC20 standard does not require to fail inside the approve function and there are multiple implementation some of them will just return false if the approve is not successful, the contract does not treat this case and it will lead to unpredictable behaviour.

**Recommendation**

The SafeERC20 library is already present in the project and it is used with safe TransferFrom and safe Transfer functions, it will be really easy to change the use of approve with the use of safeApprove all over the project

### Potentially wasted funds in `openGlpPosition` due to zero minimum GLP amount
**Description**

TracerGMXVault.sol - In body of openGlpPosition(...), last argument of function Reward RouterV2.mintAndStakeGlp called in last line of function's body represents the amount of glp to be minted in exchange for the assets transferred prior to this mint. Assigning this amount to Zero might lead to wasted funds.

**Recommendation**

Priorly retrieve info about how much glp to have in exchange for the asset and make an assessment of the_minGlp amount to put in accordance with that.

### Incorrect calculation in `usdToGlp` function in `GlpPricing.sol`
**Description**

GlpPricing.sol - usd ToGlp multiplication usdAmount * glpPrice (maximise) does not seem to be correct in this case. According to definition of GMX: https://gmxio.gitbook.io/gmx/ contracts#glp-price

Buy price: glpManager.getAum(true) / glp.totalSupply()

Assuming Asset Under Management to be usdc, hence we have an amount of usdc per each glp and the result represent glp Price. Multiplying this price to usdAmount does not give the proper result.

**Recommendation**

usdAmount / glpPrice(maximise)

### Incorrect calculation in `glpToUsd` function in `GlpPricing.sol`
**Description**

GlpPricing.sol - glpToUsd same issue as above - recommending replacing the div by mul.

**Recommendation**

Replace division with multiplication in the `glpToUsd` function.

### `mint` function in `BaseVault.sol` gives caller fewer shares than stated
**Description**

BaseVault.sol - mint (uint256 shares, address receiver) gives the caller less shares than stated in function arguments (due to accruing fee). This is not a critical issue because the user is paying the proper amount of asset for the shares s/he receives. Nonetheless, it "looks like" s/he receives less than s/he expected from his/her perspective.

PS: this might be okay if it is considered in the dapp to show to the end user how many shares s/he actually receives.

**Recommendation**

Consider updating the DApp to clearly display the actual number of shares a user will receive after fees, or align the `mint` function's `shares` argument with the post-fee amount.
