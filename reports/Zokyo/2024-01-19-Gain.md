# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Signature proof not including a domain separator
**Description**

In ERC20DistributionNative.sol & ERC20Distribution.sol - Function purchaseAllowed () posses the following risk: If a contract does not use a domainSeparator when verifying signatures: bytes calldata proof, it becomes susceptible to cross-domain attacks. An attacker could potentially take a valid signature from one context (chain, address, ...) and use it to perform unauthorized actions in a different context.

**Recommendation**

See Definition of domainSeparator in eip-712 and follow it to construct a secure proof.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Fix: Issue is addressed in commit a356632 by adding the chain.id and contract address information to function hashForKYC(). According to requirements specifications of the project a full eip-712 spec is not needed.

### No Access Control In startDistribution()
**Description**

The initial state of the ERC20Distribution.sol/ERC20DistributionNative.sol is paused (reasons are unclear, might be due to waiting for the kyc approver to be assigned first or some other factors). Keeping in mind that the contract should be paused until the devs see fit, anyone can call the startDistribution() function and unpause the system.

**Recommendation**

Unpausing the contract should be done by a privileged role ideally.

## Low Risk

### Absence of SafeERC20 library in ERC20 asset transfers
**Description**

The smart contracts under review do not incorporate the SafeERC20 library when conducting ERC20 token transfers. This has a negative impact when the ERC20 involved in the transfer does not return value. There exist older ERC20 that did not follow the standard transfer function prototype and that leads to undesirable outcomes.

**Recommendation**

It is advised to use SafeERC20 library to undergo transfers of ERC20 assets.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Fix: Issue is not addressed, SafeERC20 library is not utilized to undergo the transfers of ERC20 assets despite it is being imported in the contracts.
Update Issue resolved in commit cfaaac2

### Ensure No Fee On Transfer Tokens
**Description**

The fiat token is supposed to be a token pegged to the US dollar. There are certain tokens which incurs a fee on transfer. This means that everytime x amount of a fee on transfer tokenis transferred to an address, that address receives an amount x - fee. Due to this reason if the fiat token is a fee on transfer tokenthen the line L313 would revert (since an amount less than fiattoken_amount is transferred).

**Recommendation**

Make sure fee on transfer token cases are handled appropriately or blacklist such tokens.

## Informational

### Unnecessary redundant variable in `purchaseTokens`
**Description**

ERC20Distribution Native In function purchaseTokens () the variable inittokenbalance is declared in order to reflect the ERC20 balance of the contract:
uint256 inittokenbalance
trusted token.balanceOf (address(this));
but priorly pool balance served that purpose and the values of both variables are the same on the moment they are used:
uint256 pool_balance = trusted token.balanceOf (address(this));

**Recommendation**

Assign the quantity (i.e. ERC20 balance) once.

### Increased deployment cost due to extended error messages
**Description**

A significant concern has been identified during the audit, specifically related to the extensive use of detailed error messages within the smart contracts. While these detailed error messages offer valuable insights, it's essential to note that they contribute to an increase in the size of contracts. This, in turn, escalates deployment costs, which are paid in gas and increase the chance of hitting the deployment size threshold.
One example:
function mint (address to, uint256 amount) public {
require(
hasRole (MINTER ROLE, msgSender()),
"GainDAOToken: _msgSender() does not have the minter role"
);
mint (to, amount);
}

**Recommendation**

Use custom error objects (e.g. error UnauthorizedMinter()) or concise short error codes as revert messages. This issue is shown in all contracts within scope that use require statements.

### Sender identification discrepancy (`msg.sender` vs `_msgSender()`)
**Description**

An issue lies in the way the_msgSender() function is used within the smart contracts. The _msgSender() function is part of the Context abstract contract, and it is designed to provide a way to determine the original sender of a message in a multi-contract system. The concern here is that using msgSender () to determine the sender of the function call might not yield the intended result in the context of the contract. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior.
In summary, the issue is related to inconsistent usage of msg.sender and msgSender() across the contracts. The coding style and usage of these variables need to be aligned for clarity and correctness.

**Recommendation**

To address this concern, developers should ensure that the same method is consistently used to determine the sender across all contracts. Either use msg.sender consistently or msgSender() consistently, depending on the intended behavior.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Fix-1: The issue is partially addressed in commit a356632 All occurrences of _msgSender() are being replaced by msg.sender. Issue is resolved in all contracts except in GainDAOToken where both_msgSender() and msg.sender are being used together.
Fix-2:Issue fixed on commit cfaaac2

### `claimNativeToken` Can Be Removed From ERC20Distribution.sol
**Description**

The ERC20Distribution contract uses a fiat token (ERC20) to purchase gain tokens, ETH cannot be received bythis contract (unless forced sent vi selfdestruct), therefore the function claimNative Token is unnecessary since there can never be ETH in the contract.

**Recommendation**

claimNativeToken should be removed from ERC20Distribution.sol

### Inconsistency between rate calculation and comment in ERC20DistributionNative
**Description**

In the currentRateUndivided function in ERC20Distribution Native contract, the _current_distributed_balance increases after each call to purchase Tokens, so the offset_e18 (which is _total_distribution_balance_current_distributed_balance) decreases. This calculation causes the currentRate to decrease as well, assuming that all other variables remain constant during the single distribution. However, the comment suggests that the rate should be ascending, i.e., it should increase as_current_distributed_balance increases. In this implementation, the opposite happens: the rate decreases as _current_distributed_balance increases, which is contrary to the intended "ascending fractional linear rate" behavior.

**Recommendation**

Use the adjusted formula or change the mentioned comment.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Client comment: This issue is by design.

### Missing 0 Address Check for `changeKYCApprover`
**Description**

When assigning the kyc approver via changeKYCApprover it should be checked that the newKYCApprover is not the 0-address, if set to 0 address then purchases won't be allowed.

**Recommendation**

Introduce a address check on the function changeKYCApprover.

### Same comments for ERC20Distribution and ERC20DistributionNative
**Description**

There are instances in the ERC20Distribution contract where the comments correspond to the ERC20Distribution Native, such as comments are L272 and L273, they mention ether while it should be the fiat token.

**Recommendation**

The comments should be corrected.
