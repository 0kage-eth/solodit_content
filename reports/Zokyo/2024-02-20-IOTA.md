# Findings

## Low Risk

### Unused constant
**Description**

File: migration.ts
Constant: PERMANODE
Details:
The given constant was used in the removed code parts.

**Recommendation**

Remove the constant declaration

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved

### Function parameter never used
**Description**

File: TransferFragmented Funds.svelte
Function: migrate Funds
Details:
The function has a parameter declared as "isRerun?: boolean", however, it is never used in the function code. Looking for the function calls we can differentiate the two types of call: without parameter (defaulting to false) and with true as a value (from the rerunMigration function).

**Recommendation**

Double-check the functionality and remove the parameter if there is no need for it

### Unused variables
**Description**

File: Welcome.svelte
Variables: error, busy
Details:
There are two global variables added in the given file, and their values even being assigned during the execution, but never read

**Recommendation**

Double-check the functionality and remove the parameters if there is no need for those

### Using strings in the function
**Description**

File: Congratulations.svelte
Function: consult ExplorerClick
Details:
In the function, there is a variable "urlToOpen", which is being assigned to a URL of the explorer depending on either developer account being used or not. It is better, for refactoring and possible next modifications, to keep them outside the function and declare them as constants

**Recommendation**

Declare URL string prefixes as constants
