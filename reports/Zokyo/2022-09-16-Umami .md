# Findings

## Medium Risk

### Excessive authority for `setVault` function in `VaultOwned` contract.
**Description**

contract VaultOwned - in body of setVault( address vault_) external returns (bool) onlyOwner

Too much authority for one executor that might lead to funds embezzled if not trusted

**Recommendation**

Use multisig

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Fix-1: according to partner's response, The Umami DAO Multisig wallet is the address currently set as the vault for the Umami token. All token operations are controlled through the DAO and through governance voting

Therefore, there's no change needs to be made

## Low Risk

### `increment` in `Counters` library does not use SafeMath.
**Description**

Library Counters - in body of increment(Counter storage counter) internal

Increment is executed without using the SafeMath library.
PS: Unless that is intended to save computation cost as overflow is almost impossible to take place !

**Recommendation**

Consider using SafeMath for `increment` or ensure thorough testing for overflow conditions if omitted for gas reasons.

### Missing zero address validation for `vault_` in `setVault`.
**Description**

contract VaultOwned in body of setVault(address vault_) external returns (bool)

no validation done on vault_ address to make sure it is non-zero address

**Recommendation**

Add validation to ensure `vault_` address is not the zero address in `setVault`.

**Re-audit comment**

Invalid.

Fix-1: According to Partner this is intended by design. As vault_ shall be set to Zero Address when Max Supply is determined. Hence no more minting undergone by vault (zero address).

### Incorrect percentage calculation logic in `SafeMath` library.
**Description**

library SafeMath - in body of

percentageAmount (uint256 total, uint8 percentage_)

substractPercentage(uint256 total, uint8 percentageToSub_)

logic of these functions assume the portion to be calculated from 1000 according to this div(mul(total, percentage_), 1000);
as it is expected to be 100 also according to how percentageOfTotal is implemented.

**Recommendation**

Correct the divisor in `percentageAmount` and `substractPercentage` functions to 100 if a standard percentage calculation is intended.

## Informational

### Storage argument in `Counters.current` view function.
**Description**

library Counters - in body of

current (Counter storage counter) internal view returns (uint256)

No need to receive a storage argument in function.

**Recommendation**

- replace by memory

### Unused constant `ERC20TOKEN_ERC1820_INTERFACE_ID`.
**Description**

contract ERC20

ERC20TOKEN_ERC1820_INTERFACE_ID is never used

**Recommendation**

Remove the unused constant `ERC20TOKEN_ERC1820_INTERFACE_ID`.

### Visibility of `_burnFrom` in UMAMI contract.
**Description**

contract UMAMI - definition of

function_burn From (address account, uint256 amount_) public

From a code organization point of view, this might have been intended to be private since burnFrom is already public.

**Recommendation**

Consider changing the visibility of `_burnFrom` to private for better code organization, as a public `burnFrom` already exists.
