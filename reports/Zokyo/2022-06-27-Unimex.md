# Findings

## High Risk

### Assignment instead of comparison in UniMexFactory.sol require checks
**Description**

In contract UniMexFactory.sol in functions setUtilizationScaled and setMaxLeverage the require checks at lines 45 and 51 are assigning a value instead of comparing it. For example at line 45 the value true is assigned to allowed. require(allowed[_token] = true);

**Recommendation**

Change assignment to comparison.

### Missing check for successful transfer in ApeMexMargin autoOpen function
**Description**

In contract Apex MexMargin, function autoOpen, at line 462, there is no check to see if the transfer have been done successfully, there are some implementations of popular rc20 tokens that are using no require statements in the transfer operation and at the final are only using the return of an boolean value, the contract is already making use of SafeERC20 library and in other functions the method safe Transfer is used instead of transfer so we would recommend to implement the same pattern everywhere.

**Recommendation**

Use safeTransfer method instead of transfer method.

## Low Risk

### Potential issues when token is changed via `setToken` in UniMexStaking.sol
**Description**

In contract UniMexStaking.sol, when a new token is set by function setToken, a number of issues may arise. A user's balance can be held for a token with a certain number of decimals, then another token with a different number of decimals can be set. Then the user's balance no longer correctly reflects how many tokens he has. Another problem that may arise would be that if a new token is set, the contract does not hold enough of that token for a user to use the withdraw function.

**Recommendation**

Set the token address only through the constructor and avoid modifying it

## Informational

### Typo in filename ApemexMargin.sol
**Description**

File ApemexMargin.sol contains the contract ApeMexMargin, there is a small type in the file name, it should be called ApeMexMargin, it is part of best practices to keep the file name and contract name the same.

**Recommendation**

Rename the file ApemexMaring.sol to ApeMexMargin.sol

### Unused public variable `uniswap_factory` in ApeMexMargin
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, you are declaring the public variable uniswap_factory at line 96, and initializing with a value in the constructor at line 193, but there is no other use of it in the contract logic code.

**Recommendation**

Remove the variable uniswap_factory as it is not used in the contract logic code.

### Gas inefficiency due to `staking` variable type in ApeMexMargin
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, at line 94, variable staking is stored in contract state and is of type IUniMexMargin, this variable is used around in the contract logic code to make external calls to a contract, it would be more gas efficient to store the variable as an address type instead of type IUniMexMargin and to initialize the interface in place, because this way the interface will be stored in memory instead of storage and it is cheaper to read from memory.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of variable to address, and initialize the interface inside the function when it is used.

In contract ApeMexMargin, at line 95, variable unimex_factory is stored in contract state and is of type IUniMexFactory, this variable is used around in the contract logic code to make external calls to a contract, it would be more gas efficient to store the variable as an address type instead of type IUniMexFactory and to initialize the interface in place, because this way the interface will be stored in memory instead of storage and it is cheaper to read from memory.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of variable to address, and initialize the interface inside the function when it is used.

### Gas inefficiency due to `uniswap_router` variable type in ApeMexMargin
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, at line 97, variable uniswap_router is stored in contract state and is of type IUnswapV2Router02, this variable is used around in the contract logic code to make external calls to a contract, it would be more gas efficient to store the variable as an address type instead of type IUniswapv2Router02 and to initialize the interface in place, because this way the interface will be stored in memory instead of storage and it is cheaper to read from memory.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of variable to address, and initialize the interface inside the function when it is used.

### Gas inefficiency due to `swapPathCreator` variable type in ApeMexMargin
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, at line 98, variable swapPathCreator is stored in contract state and is of type ISwapPathCreator, this variable is used around in the contract logic code to make external calls to a contract, it would be more gas efficient to store the variable as an address type instead of type ISwapPathCreator and to initialize the interface in place, because this way the interface will be stored in memory instead of storage and it is cheaper to read from memory.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of variable to address, and initialize the interface inside the function when it is used.

### Gas inefficiency due to `unimexConfig` variable type in ApeMexMargin
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, at line 95, variable unimexConfig is stored in contract state and is of type IUnimexConfig, this variable is used around in the contract logic code to make external calls to a contract, it would be more gas efficient to store the variable as an address type instead of type IUnimexConfig and to initialize the interface in place, because this way the interface will be stored in memory instead of storage and it is cheaper to read from memory.

**Recommendation**

Change the type of variable to address, and initialize the interface inside the function when it is used.

### Unnecessary casting in `swapTokens` function in ApeMexMargin
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, in function swap Tokens, at line 829, you are initializing the IUniswapv2Router02 object using as parameter the uniswap_router variable, which is already saved in contract storage as type IUniswapRouter02 in conclusion is a casting to the same type, it is making the function more gas expense without any reasons because the casting to the same type it is not needed.

**Recommendation**

If you chose to keep the same type of storage for uniswap_router remove the use of IUniswap Router02 casting and just simply use the uniswap_router variable, if you chose to change the type of uniswap_router to addresses type, then leave it like that.

### Setter `setThresholdGasPrice` in ApeMexMargin does not emit an event
**Description**

In contract ApeMexMargin, the function setThreshold GasPrice, it's a setter that does not emit an event, it would be part of best practices to add events for all your setters to be able to track the change of values on-chain.

### Initialization of `projectDivsDistributorAddress` with unimplemented ProjectDivsDistributor.sol
**Description**

In contract UniMexStaking.sol at line 49, inside the constructor projectDivs DistributorAddress variable is initialized. The ProjectDivs Distributor.sol file has no implemented methods.

**Recommendation**

If the ProjectDivsDistributor won't have any implementation, then simply remove the projectDivsDistributorAddress initialization.

### Gas inefficiency for WETH storage in UniMexStaking.sol
**Description**

In contract UniMexStaking.sol WETH is initialized as IERC20 inside the constructor at line 47, then stored and used throughout the contract.

**Recommendation**

In order to save gas, consider storing the WETH address and use in-place initialization when calling IERC20 methods, similar to how you use the token. Only the address is stored and then initialized when needed e.g at line 143.

### Gas optimization by caching array length in `distributeToken` in ProjectDivsDistributor
**Description**

In contract ProjectDivs Distributor, in function distribute Token, there can be an optimization on saving gas by saving the value of addresses.length in a value in memory, because every time the for loop will read the value it will read it from storage, but if you made that modification, the value will be readed from memory and it is cheaper to read from memory then from storage:

**Recommendation**

Save the value of addresses.length in a variable that is in memory and replace the use of addresses.length with the variable that is stored in memory.

### Gas inefficiency for pool token and WETH storage in `initialize` function of UniMexPool.sol
