# Findings

## High Risk

### Deprecated ETH transfer in LimitOrderProtocolRFQ.
**Description**

LimitOrder ProtocolRFQ.sol: function fillOrderRFQTo(), line 165. Due to the Istanbul update there were several changes provided to the EVM, which made .transfer() and .send() methods deprecated for the ETH transfer. Thus it is highly recommended to use .call() functionality with mandatory result check, or the built-in functionality of the Address contract from OpenZeppelin library.

**Recommendation**

Correct ETH sending functionality.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Fixed after the 1st audit iteration

### Deprecated ETH transfer in UniERC20.
**Description**

UniERc20.sol: function uniTransfer(), line 38. UniERc20.sol: function uniTransferFrom(), line 53. Due to the Istanbul update there were several changes provided to the EVM, which made transfer() and .send() methods deprecated for the ETH transfer. Thus it is highly recommended to use .call() functionality with mandatory result check, or the built-in functionality of the Address contract from OpenZeppelin library.

**Recommendation**

Correct ETH sending functionality.

## Medium Risk

### Performance of swap can be blocked.
**Description**

GenericRouter.sol: function swap(), line 84. In case, there are unspent source tokens after swap, unspent amount is subtracted from spentAmount. In case a malicious actor transfers some amount of source tokens to contract, which would be greater than spentAmount of swap, subtraction will underflow, reverting transaction.

**Recommendation**

Since a contract is not supposed to hold any tokens, consider adding a function to sweep any provided tokens in order for the protocol not to get blocked.

**Re-audit comment**

1inch team is acknowledged about the issue.

## Informational

### Commented out code.
**Description**

OrderLib.sol: struct Order, lines 18-25. ClipperRouter.sol: function clipperSwapTo(), lines 99-100, 130. Preproduction code should not contain unfinished logic or commented code.

**Recommendation**

Remove commented code.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.
Post-audit:
For OrderLib these comments are left to explain the structure of comressed bytes data. For ClipperRouter they are left to explain what assembly code is supposed to do. We'll keep them as we think that they provide some information for the reader.
