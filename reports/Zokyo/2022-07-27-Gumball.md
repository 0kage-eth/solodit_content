# Findings

## High Risk

### XGBT, pegged to Gumball NFTs, can be withdrawn directly for GBT.
**Description**

Gumbar.sol. Gumbar allows users to receive and redeem XGBT it two ways: by staking GBT and by staking Gumball NFTs. It is checked against an amount of NFTs locked by the user, that XGBT, pegged to Gumballs, cannot be redeemed directly for GBT tokens. However, in case XGBT, received for staking Gumball NFTs, are transferred with standard ERC20 transfer functions to another address, locked NFTs are not transferred to the other address'es locked NFTs as well. Due to this, XGBT, which were minted for Gumball NFTs, can now be redeemed for GBT tokens. This can lead to scenarios, where there won't be enough GBT for other users, preventing them from receiving their funds and scenarios, where Gumball NFTs are locked forever.

**Recommendation**

Transfer locked NFTs to other user's locks in case transferred XGBT are pegged to Gumball NFTS.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:

XGBT can be transferred to limited number of addresses, such as the Gumbar itself, BondingCurve, zero address. The commit with fix is 22d3a460059225a51c8face497afd4a60a36802d.

### Redeeming requires additional approval and Gumball to inherit IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable.
**Description**

Gumball.sol

Due to external call of safe TransferFrom on address(this), Redeeming required additional approval of Gumball NFTs by the user. It also requires Gumball to inherit IERC721Receiver Upgradeable and implement onERC721Received() function. Although issue is marked as critical, since currently redeem() reverts due to absence of onERC721Received() implemented, it should be verified, in case another version of ERC721 is used, where this check is missed.

**Recommendation**

Either use internal_transfer() function instead of external safe TransferFrom() or implement onERC721Received(). Verify the necessity of additional approval tokens for Gumball in order to perform redeeming.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:

transferFrom() is used, which doesn't call onERC721Received(). Approval to Gumball for redeeming NFTs remained.

### Accuracy loss during swapping GBT for Gumball NFTS.
**Description**

Gumball.sol: function swap(). During swap, the quantity of NFTs, which can be minted for provided amount of GBT, is calculated. Since one NFT is worth Y GBT (YeY8 in wei amount), in case the user provides an amount, which is not divisible by YeY8, some amount might be lost by the user, since the whole provided amount of GBT is transferred from the user. Example:

1. User passes 2.5e18 wei of GBT tokens to function swap().
2. 2 Gumball NFT, worth 2e18 wei of GBT, is minted for user, however 2.5e18 wei of GBT is transferred.
3. When a user redeems his NFTs, he only receives 2 GBT, losing 0.5 GBT tokens.

**Recommendation**

Take only the amount of GBT from user, necessary for the purchasing of Gumball NFTS.

## Medium Risk

### SafeERC20 should be used.
**Description**

Transferring of BASE and XGBT token is performed with regular transfer() and transferFrom() methods from the OpenZeppeling IERCO interface. Though, in general, the ERCO token may have not return value for these methods (see USDT implementation) and lead to the failure of calls and contract blocking. Thus the SafeERCO library should be used or the token should be verified to implement to implement return values for transfer() and transferFrom() methods

**Recommendation**

Use SafeERCO library for transferring BASE token.

## Low Risk

### SafeMath usage can be omitted.
**Description**

Contracts set utilizes Solidity 0.8.x, which has built in support of overflow and underflow warnings, thus SafeMath library can be omitted for gas savings and code simplification.

**Recommendation**

Remove SafeMath library.

### Parameters lack validation.
**Description**

Factory.sol: function deployProxies(). Since function can be called by anyone and input parameters are vital for deployed contracts, parameters should be verified to be valid.

**Recommendation**

1. Verify that strings "name", "symbol" and values from array "_URIs" are not empty.
2. Verify that the length of array_URIs equals 2 (Containing base token URI and contract URI).
3. Verify that "_supplyCAP" and "_init_vBase" are not equal 0. Consider also adding a minimum value for these variables.
4. Verify that "_baseToken" and "artist" are zero addresses.
5. Verify that "_delay" parameter is not extremely small or great by adding minimum and maximum boundaries for this parameter.

## Informational

### Unnecessary storage write in _pop function.
**Description**

Gumball.sol: function_pop(), line 215.

Gumbar.sol: function _pop(), line 205.

On line 215, an element to be removed is being written to the last element of the array. Since, this element is removed in the next line of code, the writing of the element to the last position of array is unnecessary.

**Recommendation**

Remove unnecessary writing to storage to decrease gas spendings.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit.

Function was removed in Gumball.sol. Iteration in Gumbar still remains, however it is iterated through user's data.

### Storage array iteration in findGumball function.
**Description**

Gumball.sol: function findGumball(), line 89.
Gumbar.sol: function findGumball(), line 182.

Iteration through a storage array increases user's gas spendings and in case there are a lot of elements in the array, the function will consume more gas than allowed per transaction. Issue is marked as info, since the supply of NFTs is limited and has to be large to consume more gas than allowed during iteration, however, users' gas spendings can be decreased.

**Recommendation**

Consider using mapping which will store the position of NFT in an array to avoid iteration through a storage array.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:

Issue was resolved in Gumball contract. Issue wasn't resolved in Gumbar, since the iteration is performed for the user's data.

### Unnecessary storage variables.
**Description**

1. Gumball.sol: variable supplyCap. Variable is supposed to limitate the supply of NFTS, however it is never used. Since the possible amount of NFTs to be minted is limited by the supply of GBT, the absence of using the supplyCap is not limited. Also, during initialization supplyCap is assigned to the same variable, that initial_totalSupply and reserveGBT, which means that this cap for Gumball should be divided by 1e18.
2. ERC20Bonding Curve.sol: variables initial_totalSupply, floorPrice. Variables are never used within the contract.

**Recommendation**

1. Either use supplyCap variable to limitate the amount of NFTs, which can be minted, or remove the variables.
2. Either confirm the necessity of variables (For external contracts of Dapp for example) or remove unused variables.

**Re-audit comment**

### Unused functions.
**Description**

Factory.sol: function isClone().

Gumball.sol: function_baseURI().

Internal functions are never used within the contracts.

**Recommendation**

Remove unused functions.

### Unnecessary require statement in repaySome.
**Description**

ERC20BondingCurve.sol: function repay Some(), line 363.

Checking that the result of function sub() of SafeMath is greater or equal to 0 is unnecessary and will never revert, since function sub() either returns a positive result or reverts due to arithmetic underflow.

**Recommendation**

Remove unnecessary require statement.

### Clarity on collateral liquidation.
**Description**

ERC20BondingCurve.sol

Protocol allows users to borrow Base token for XGBT, however, in lending protocols, the position of the user can be liquidated under certain circumstances (After some period of time or in case user's borrow balance collateral value). Liquidation function is missed in protocol and its necessity should be verified, since the collateral is token, which can only be bought for base token. This means that in case a user doesn't repay his debt, he doesn't prevent other users from selling GBT for Base tokens.

**Recommendation**

Verify the necessity of a liquidation function for borrowed positions.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:

There is never a liquidation of collateral under any circumstances.

### Additional approval for selling GBT.
**Description**

ERC20BondingCurve.sol

Performing selling GBT requires the user to approve his GBT for GBT contract (ERC20Bonding Curve) before selling. This happens due to an external call to address(this) in Line 240, where ERC20Bonding Curve becomes msg.sender and requires an allowance from the user to spend his tokens.

**Recommendation**

Avoid the necessity of additional approvals by using ERC20 internal_transfer() function or verify that this is an intended functionality (For example, if protocol requires user's additional confirmation that he wishes to sell GBT).

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

Post-audit:

The neccesity of approval remains, which seems to be an intended functionality.

### Audit fixes location.
**Description**

It should be documented, that all the fixes, performed by Gumball team, are made in separate folder with duplicates of code. The issue is informational and should be present in final report.

**Recommendation**

Move all the fixed contracts to /contracts directory.
