# Findings

## High Risk

### Unrestricted call to `setConfig`


**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved



**Location:** TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**

The `setConfig()` function within the smart contracts poses a significant security risk due to
its unrestricted accessibility. Any wallet or address can call this function, allowing any caller
to delete the registered instance. The validation in this function `require(creator ==
_creator,"Only Creator can Call");` checks that the `_creator` is the registered
creator recorded in the contract state. But this check does not hinder the attacker because
the attacker can simply call this function with the intended `_creator = creator` in order to
carry out this call successfully.
```solidity
function setConfig(Config memory _config, address _creator) external {
require(creator == _creator,"Only Creator can Call");
config = _config;
}
```
This unrestricted access can have a severe impact on the ongoing operation of the smart
contract, potentially leading to unauthorized destruction of critical contract components and
disruption of essential functionalities. Attacker is capable of changing the config without
the consent of the creator.

**Recommendation:**

Validate that msg.sender is the registered creator.

### Incorrect Claim Logic


**Severity**: Critical

**Status**: Resolved

**description**
 
Users can claim the extra USDB (same issue for TokenSaleETH.sol) using the function `claim`
in TokenSaleUSDB.sol , if `s.left > 0` that would mean there are USDB to claim , `s.left` is
compared with the current balance of USDB in the contract at L263 to calculate “left” , these
left tokens are then transferred to the user.

But the `s.left` updated at L265 is incorrect , instead of deducting left from `s.left` , the whole of
`s.left` is deducted and emptied out , therefore in a condition where the contract had
insufficient USDB to fulfill the claim the `s.left` would be emptied anyhow and the user won’t
be able to claim the rest .

**Recommendation:**

Change the update to `s.left -= left`

### Incorrect Decimals For `unsoldTokens`

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

In the contract `TokenSaleETH` (same issue in TokenSaleUSDB) , in the function
`takeUSDBRaised()` the `unsoldTokens` are calculated as `(unsold * (10 ** ETH_DECIMAL))/
tokenPrice` , this amount is the amount of ‘`tokenAddress`’ tokens therefore should be in
`tokenAddress` decimals , but the above formula always returns in 1e18 rather than
`tokenAddress` decimals . Therefore if say the `tokenAddress` is a token with 12 decimals then
the `unsoldTokens` would still be in 1e18 which would be a value 1e6 times higher than
expected.

**Recommendation:**

Normalise the decimals accordingly (a division by decimal difference).

### Vesting Logic Would Keep Reverting For An Edge Case

**Severity**: High

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The normal flow in the system is , users deposit , they deposit is raised and liquidity is added
to pancakeSwap and users can vest their shares using the function `vesting()` .
In the contract `TokenSaleUSDB` (same for `TokenSaleETH.sol`) the `decimalDifference` is
calculated at L281 which is used to normalise the `amountFinal` . But if the `tokenAddress’s`
decimal is more than 18 then the calculation at L281 would always revert due to overflow.
Therefore a malicious user can create a `TokenSale` where token is a token with 22 decimals
and make the users deposit their share into the pool , but the users would never be able to
claim their vest due to the overflow error .

**Recommendation:**

Restrict token to 18 decimals or normalise accordingly.

## Medium Risk

### Lack of ERC20 Token Transfer Validation


**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved



**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol

**description**

Function `createPoolNew()` initiates ERC20 token transfers without validating the return
value of the transfer operation. This oversight can result in unhandled transfer failures,
compromising the contract's functionality and exposing it to potential vulnerabilities.
```solidity
310 IERC20D(_params.tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, instance,
(_params.totalSupply + _params.tokenLiquidity));
```
There are also two occurrences in TokenSaleUSDB.sol in lines 236, 246:
```solidity
236 if(params.tokenLiquidity - tokenAmount > 0)
IERC20D(params.tokenAddress).transfer(creator, params.tokenLiquidity -
tokenAmount);
...
246 if (liquidity > 0) IERC20D(pair).transfer(creator,liquidity);
```

**Risks:** Unintended Consequences: Failing to validate token transfers may lead to unhandled
failures, causing unintended consequences in contract state and potentially resulting in
financial losses.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure secure and reliable ERC20 token transfers, it is recommended to use `SafeERC20`
Library to ensure safe and reliable token transfers, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities
associated with ERC20 token handling.

**Fix** - Issue is addressed in commit 021212d and Fixed.

### Missing `disableInitializers` Call in Proxy Upgradeable Contract Constructor

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**

A concern arises due to the usage of a proxy upgradeable contract without calling
`disableInitializers` in the constructor of the logic contract. This oversight introduces a severe
risk, allowing potential attackers to initialize the implementation contract itself.

**Recommendation:**

Call `disableInitializers`: Include a call to `disableInitializers` in the constructor of
the logic contract.

### Incorrect Calculation Of `amountFinal`

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

In contract `TokenSaleETH.sol` (same for `TokenSaleUSDB.sol`) when `vesting()` is called it
calculates the `amountFinal` value at L261 . When there is no decimal difference and the
calculated amount is less than balance then that calculated amount is assigned as
`amountFinal` , else the balance is the `amountFinal`.

If there is a decimal difference and the calculated amount is more than balance then that
amount is assigned as the `amountfinal` which is incorrect , we should assign bal in this case
as `amountFinal` , the code is assigning a higher value than the available balance to the
`amountfinal`.

**Recommendation:**

Change the code as suggested.

### 0 Slippage Protection

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

When Liquidity is added to the pancake router , the `amountAMin` and `amountBMin` params
are being passed as 0 (L231 and L232 in TokenSaleUSDB , same for TokenSaleETH) which
essentially means 0 protection against slippage impacts , these values should be assigned
to a non-zero safe value to ensure the slippage is within accepted range.

**Recommendation:**

Assign the values to non-zero values.

## Low Risk

### Reentrance Attack Exploit in `claim()` Function

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** TokenSaleETH.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol

**description**


The `claim()` function is susceptible to a reentrancy attack due to its design allowing
external calls (i.e. line 240) to be made to other contracts (i.e. `msg.sender`) before the
completion of its own state changes and balance updates. An attacker can exploit this
vulnerability by invoking the `claim()` function and subsequently reentering it multiple times,
potentially draining the contract s funds by manipulating its state or performing unauthorized
transfers.
```solidity
225 function claim() external {
226 require(isRaiseClaimed, "takeUSDBRaised not called");
227 require(
228 uint8(epoch) > 1 && !admin.blockClaim(address(this)),
229 "Not time or not allowed"
230 );
231
232 Staked storage s = stakes[msg.sender];
233 require(s.amount != 0, "No Deposit");
234 if(s.share == 0) (s.share, s.left) = _claim(s);
235 require(s.left != 0, "Nothing to Claim");
```

```solidity
237 if(s.left > 0){
238 uint bal = address(this).balance;
239 uint left = s.left < bal ? s.left : bal;
240 ETHTransfer(msg.sender, left);
241 s.left -= s.left;
242 emit Claim(msg.sender, left);
}
}
```

**Recommendation:**

**Use Reentrancy guard**: Implement reentrancy guard or state variables to prevent reentrancy
by blocking reentrant calls to the `claim()` function while a transaction is in progress.

**Fix** - Issue is addressed in commit 021212d and partially resolved. Reentrancy guard is
added to the contract and nonReentrant modifier is being applied to the function. The issue
now is effectively mitigated but it is worth noting that ReentrancyGuard being used is not an
upgradeable version.

It is also recommended that `s.left -= left;` be executed before ETHTransfer(msg.sender,
left); since using checks-effects-interactions pattern helps mitigate that exploitation.

**Fix** - Issue revisited in commit 1474b46 in which client moved `s.left -= left` before
`ETHTransfer` to abide by CEI pattern this in turn lowers the severity of reentrancy.

**Fix**: At commit 5c0e17cb92 : Both `TokenSaleETH.sol` and `TokenSaleUSDB.sol` inherit the
Upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard as suggested , however it is not initialized to the
proper state in Function initialize.

### Non-upgradeable contracts inherited

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol

**description**

Across the protocol, several contracts that are upgradeable are inheriting non upgradeable
Base Contracts:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```
OpenZeppelin has provided an upgradeable version of the same contracts and that needs to
be used here.
The same goes for any other OpenZeppelin Contract to be imported in an upgradeable
contract.

**Recommendation:**

Import the OZ’s contracts as described here.

**Fix**: At commit 5c0e17cb92 : Client inherited the required upgradeable contracts and
initialized them in the initialize function in Admin.sol. In both TokenSaleETH.sol and
TokenSaleUSDB.sol the Upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard is inherited as suggested ,
however it is not initialized to the proper state in Function initialize.

## Informational

### The address of USDB refers to a test chain

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol

**description**

In function `initialize()` it is noted that contract not ready to operate properly because
address of USDB refers to the testnet while it should be

```solidity
0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003.
57 function initialize(address _owner) public initializer {
58 _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _owner);
59 _setRoleAdmin(OPERATOR, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE);
60 wallet = _owner;
61 platformFee = 2 * (10 ** 17);
62 platformTax = 500;
63 USDB = 0xA9F81589Cc48Ff000166Bf03B3804A0d8Cec8114;
}
```
### Lack of Event Emission in Privileged Functions

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** Admin.sol, TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**

During the security audit of the smart contract, an issue has been identified in the
implementation of privileged functions, one example is function
`setMasterContractUSDB(addres )`. The codebase has not incorporated event emission
within several of these privileged functions. The absence of events in these operations limits
transparency, hindering the ability to monitor and track critical changes to the contract's
state.

**Recommendation:**

Emit the relevant events on calling privileged functions.

**Fix** - Issue has been addressed in commit 021212d and partially resolved. The issue in
contracts `TokenSaleUSDB` and `TokenSaleETH` is not being addressed. Functions like
`setUSDB` and `setConfig` are admin functions that are being invoked making significant
privileged changes without announcing these changes.

### Redundant Checks

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The check at L261 (`TokenSaleUSDB.sol`) is redundant , this is because the require statement
at L259 ensures `s.left` is more than 0.

Another instance is check at L181 TokenSale.sol , this check would always be true due to the
require statement at L174.


**Recommendation:**

The if condition can be removed.

### Confusing Function Name And Comments


**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**description**

The function `takeUSDBRaised()` in the contract `TokenSaleETH.sol` does not take the USDB
raised in the epoch rather it’s the ETH that was deposited in the round , it should be named
accordingly . Plus , all the comments in the contract has been copied from the
`TokenSaleUSDB` contract and should be changed.

Recommendation:

Change the comments and the function name accordingly.

### Improving Clarity and Functionality of setConfig Method

**Severity**: Informational

**Status**: Resolved

**Location:** TokenSaleUSDB.sol, TokenSaleETH.sol

**description**


The setConfig function is unclear and could lead to confusion. The function appears to
intend that only the creator of the contract should call it. However, the actual caller in the
context of the protocol is the Admin contract via the createPoolNew function. This
discrepancy may cause misunderstanding for developers attempting to interact with the
contract.
Furthermore, the function is designed to be called only once, and it could be more intuitive
to call it within the initialize function rather than as a separate transaction.

**Recommendation:**

Consider revising the function to enhance clarity and align its behavior with the intended
usage of the contract. Additionally, ensure that comments or documentation are provided to
clarify the intended usage and the role of the caller. This will help improve readability and
reduce the risk of misinterpretation by developers interacting with the contract.
