# Findings

## High Risk

### Unprotected initializer.
**Description**

v2/FiatTokenV2.sol, initializeV2()

v2/Fiat TokenV2_1.sol, initializeV2_1()

Function serves as additional initializer after the token upgrade. Though, since the second version is not initialized in an atomic way (like it was for the first version initialized during the Proxy contract creation) and requires a separate call it should be protected against unauthorized calls (e.g. restricted to the owner only). Or, there should be a proof that function will be called through the AdminProxy upgradeAndCall() (e.g. with the appropriate deployment script). The issue is marked as high, since the initialization will change the storage to contain a new name and update initialization version. Though it is not critical, since it does not change critical for the protocol storage.

**Recommendation**

Add appropriate protection against unauthorized call, or provide a deployment/upgrade script with transparent upgradeAndCall() call.

**Re-audit comment**

Acknowledged.

Post-audit:

StablR team is acknowledged of the issue and stated that is the acceptable risk. StablR team will mitigate it by running deployment and initialization before announcement, after that it is immutable. Additionally StablR team will carefully check what happens after deployment, as they can spot what activity takes place subsequently.

## Informational

### Additional protection checks.
**Description**

v1/Pausable.sol.

Additional checks to not allow pause already paused or unpause already unpaused (for pause() and unpause()).

v1/Blacklistable.sol

Additional checks to not block already blocked or unblock already unblocked account (for blacklist() and unBlacklist()). Such checks will increase the quality of the code and will stop misleading extra transactions for pause/unpause, block/unblock.

**Recommendation**

Consider adding additional checks.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

Post-audit:

StablR team stated that is acceptable risk, since only StablR is able to do these actions. Manually the risk is to pay additional gas fees because the repeating actions continue to respond with 200 successful while the contract or address is already paused or blacklisted. When automating these actions, StablR team has several ways to tackle this (both on chain as off chain)

### Master minter is not a minter by default.
**Description**

FiatTokenV1.sol

This is not a security issue, though since masterMinter has the role by this name, it supposed to have default rights for minting. Though the initializer does not add masterMinter as default minter.

**Recommendation**

Consider adding masterMinter as default minter as well.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

Post-audit:

StablR team has verified that masterMinter is considered to be a control role instead of an actionable role, therefore it stays as is and is only able to assign Minter and allowance of the Minter.

### Extra tokens rescue, but not Ether.
**Description**

Rescuable.sol

The contract has functionality to rescue extra token sent by mistake to the FiatToken contract. Though there is no "mirror" functionality for Ether sent by mistake.

**Recommendation**

Consider adding Eth rescue functionality or verify that this functionality is not needed for the contract.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

Post-audit:

StablR team has confirmed that they are keeping track of activity and can mitigate any Eth sent by mistake by Upgradability of the contract and adding this functionality if this would occur.

### Non-standard field.
**Description**

FiatToken contract

The contract inherits ERC20 standard interface, though it contains non-standard field "currency". It seems to be readonly and not used throughout the contracts, thus needs verification from the StablR team for the purpose of the field.

**Recommendation**

Verify correct usage of the additional field.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

Post-audit:

StablR team has confirmed that this additional field is correctly used to make sure users of the contract can additionaly distinguish usage of the contract based on the currency.

### Cancel on behalf.
**Description**

v2/FiatTokenV2.sol, cancelAuthorization()

v2/EIP3009.sol, _cancelAuthorization()

Function allows cancel on behalf of the authorizer in case if the user has access to the signature of the authorizer. Thus, in case of the "man in the middle" attack, when the user stores cancel receipts (which should be regular practice to store potential cancel receipt for each provided transfer/receive signature), the 3rd party user may cancel valid requests on behalf. The issue is marked as info due to the complexity of the attack, and due to the fact that in most cases it means leaked private key, which is out of the scope of the audit. Though, the point of allowance cancels on behalf refers to the business logic of the protocol, thus it should be reflected in the report.

**Recommendation**

Verify, that cancel on behalf is valid within the business logic of the protocol or add appropriate check against msg.sender to _cancelAuthorization() function.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

Post-audit:

The team has confirmed the correctness of the business-logic
