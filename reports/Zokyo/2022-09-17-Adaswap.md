# Findings

## Low Risk

### Extra gas consumption in Math library sqrt function.
**Description**

The sqrt function from the Math library increases gas consumption as the value passed increases. Optimizing the smart contract's consumption of gas, and therefore the associated transaction costs, can reduce the cost of a transaction. It also has the potential to prevent malicious use of smart contracts.
Location:
./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol #12

**Recommendation**

The sqrt function from the Math library can be replaced by a more gas-efficient square root implementation, such as the one provided in the audit report (taken from openzeppelin-contracts), to reduce transaction costs for larger input values.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.
Decision:
Replaced and tests fixed in commit @642630b.

### Inefficient use of array for counting pairs in AdaswapFactory.
**Description**

In the presented smart contract infrastructure, the allPairs array in AdaswapFactory is used for counting all created pairs. Using an array to store and retrieve the number of created pairs is not an optimal solution. In the case of iterating over the allPairs array, it would need to be split into chunks with constant gas, and furthermore, iterating the array from the outer contract would be very expensive, requiring one call to read each element.
Location:
- ./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol #12

**Recommendation**

The allPairs array in AdaswapFactory can be replaced with a simple counter. Also change the IAdaswapFactory interface and the allPairsLength function.

**Re-audit comment**

Acknowledged.
Decision:
The developers decided to leave the array implementation in our current infrastructure, because it can be useful to get a paired address by index.

## Informational

### Unnecessary assembly usage for chain ID.
**Description**

Chain ID is available in the original Solidity 0.8.0 release. This way you can get the chain ID, such as a block timestamp. (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/units-and-global-variables.html)
Location:
- ./core/contracts/AdaswapERC20.sol #22-31

**Recommendation**

The assembly statement can be replaced with the native variable block.chainid.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.
Decision:
Replaced and tests fixed in commit @c6fcdbb.

### Standard ERC-20 approve function usage.
**Description**

Ethereum mempool is the place where all pending transactions sit until the miner decides to include them into the block. For most cases, transactions with the highest gas prices are included first as the miners get the gas price for including these transactions into the block. Using a front-running attack one can spend approved tokens before the allowance value is updated.

**Recommendation**

Set to the setting for one transaction allowance. The second transaction is approved for the new desired amount. Or use non-standard functions increase Allowance() and decreaseAllowance().

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.
Decision:
Added functions increase Allowance and decreaseAllowance from Openzeppelin ERC20 standard in commit @1ae3ัะต6.

### Unnecessary override keyword.
**Description**

Since Solidity 0.8.0 release, we can remove the override keyword to implement interface functions.
Location:
./core/contracts/AdaswapERC20.sol
./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol
./core/contracts/Adaswap Pair.sol

**Recommendation**

Remove the unnecessary override keyword.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.
Decision:
Removed all unnecessary keywords in commit @ebafb3c.

### Missing zero address validation for feeToSetter.
**Description**

Missing zero address validation of feeToSetter.
Location:
./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol #9
./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol #50

**Recommendation**

It is recommended to validate the variable_feeToSetter to contain a non-zero value before the assignment. Or implement the logic to delete the variable when it is set to zero address, which will allow you to get a gas refund for freeing up storage space. If for some reason it is necessary to permanently block access to changing_feeToSetter, that is, set a zero address in _feeToSetter, then instead of setting a zero value in_feeToSetter directly, you can delete it from the storage. That would provide a refund for this transaction (no more than half from the cost of the transaction or 15,000). In the original version, the zero address is set directly, and in the version with the deletion, the zero address will also be set to zero plus we will get a refund, but the deletion must be written in the code.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.
Decision:
Added validation in commit @84cbf03.

### Weak PRNG usage.
**Description**

Weak PRNG due to a modulo on block.timestamp, now or blockhash. These can be influenced by miners to some extent, so they should be avoided.
Location:
- ./core/contracts/AdaswapPair.sol #60-73

**Recommendation**

Avoid using block.timestamp, now, or blockhash for Pseudo-Random Number Generation due to potential miner influence.

### Dangerous strict equalities (AdaswapPair.sol #97-118).
**Description**

Use of strict equalities that can be easily manipulated by an attacker.
Location:
./core/contracts/AdaswapPair.sol #97-118

**Recommendation**

Review and refactor strict equalities to prevent potential manipulation by attackers.

### Reentrancy pattern detected (no impact).
**Description**

Detection of the reentrancy bug. State variables written after the initialize call.
Location:
- ./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol #26-41

**Recommendation**

Ensure adherence to the checks-effects-interactions pattern, even if current impact is assessed as none, to prevent future vulnerabilities.

### Timestamp usage for deadline check.
**Description**

A block.timestamp value can be manipulated by miners.
Location:
./core/contracts/AdaswapERC20.sol #74-86

**Recommendation**

Be aware of miner influence on block.timestamp when used for critical logic like deadlines. Consider alternative mechanisms if precise timing is crucial and vulnerable to manipulation.

**Re-audit comment**

Decision: Noted. This does not affect core functionality.

### Timestamp usage in AdaswapPair update.
**Description**

A block.timestamp value can be manipulated by miners.
Location:
-./core/contracts/AdaswapPair.sol #60-73

**Recommendation**

Be aware of miner influence on block.timestamp. If used for critical calculations sensitive to manipulation, consider alternative approaches.

**Re-audit comment**

Acknowledged.
Decision: Noted. This does not affect core functionality.

### Assembly usage in AdaswapFactory.
**Description**

The use of assembly is error-prone and should be avoided.
Location:
- ./core/contracts/AdaswapFactory.sol #26-41

**Recommendation**

Minimize or replace assembly usage with standard Solidity constructs where possible to improve readability and reduce error-proneness, unless strictly necessary for specific low-level operations or gas optimization.

**Re-audit comment**

Acknowledged.
Decision: Noted. This does not affect core functionality.

### Low-level call usage in AdaswapPair _safeTransfer.
**Description**

The use of low-level calls is error-prone. Low-level calls do not check for code existence or call success.
Location:
./core/contracts/AdaswapPair.sol #43-46

**Recommendation**

Ensure low-level calls (`.call()`) properly check return values and handle potential failures, or use higher-level alternatives like `.transfer()` or SafeERC20 library functions where appropriate.

**Re-audit comment**

Acknowledged.
Decision: Noted. This does not affect core functionality.

### Non-conformance to Solidity naming conventions.
**Description**

Naming conventions are powerful when adopted and used broadly. The use of different conventions can convey significant meta information that would otherwise not be immediately available. Specific instances: Parameter_feeTo is not in mixedCase (AdaswapFactory.sol #43). Parameter_feeToSetter is not in mixedCase (AdaswapFactory.sol #48). Function AdaswapCall is not in mixedCase (IAdaswapCallee.sol #5). Parameter_token is not in mixedCase (AdaswapPair.sol #53). Parameter_token1 is not in mixedCase (AdaswapPair.sol #53). Function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is not in mixedCase (IAdaswapERC20.sol #8). Function PERMIT_TYPEHASH is not in mixedCase (IAdaswapERC20.sol #9). Variable DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is not in mixedCase (AdaswapERC20.sol #15). Function MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY is not in mixedCase (IAdaswapPair.sol #20).

**Recommendation**

Adhere to standard Solidity naming conventions (e.g., mixedCase for functions and parameters, ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants) for better readability and consistency.
