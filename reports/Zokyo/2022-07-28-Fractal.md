# Findings

## High Risk

### Duplicate of increment.
**Description**

Treasury Module function withdrawERC20Tokens

100: for (uint256 index $=0;$ index < tokenAddressesLength; index ++) {

105:

106:

unchecked {

index ++;

107:

}

In one cycle, the index is incremented twice.

**Recommendation**

Remove increment from for head part.

### Non-minteble token.
**Description**

VotesToken.sol, Votes TokenWithSupply.sol

This token does not have external mint and burn functions. That is, when creating it, the number of tokens will not change. Even if you use Votes Token WithSupply - in addition to the initial amount, over time you cannot influence the number of tokens in any way.

**Recommendation**

Consider extending the functionality of mint and burn. Perhaps at least give a similar opportunity to the role of an owener, or something like that.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:

This isn't a bug, but more of a design decision. Fractal team has decided for governance tokens to have a fixed supply that cannot be changed, and to keep this code as is.

## Medium Risk

### Invalid auth require in Timelock.
**Description**

Timelock.sol

46: function updateDelay(uint256 newDelay) external virtual authorized {

47:

require(

48:

msg.sender == address(this),

49:

"TimelockController: caller must be timelock"

50:

);

51:

emit MinDelayChange(minDelay, newDelay);

52:

minDelay = newDelay;

53: }

This method cannot be executed. Because the method has a check that it can only be called by the contract itself. No calls to this method were found in the rest of the code. Also, in the entire protocol, it was not found possible to execute this method on behalf of this contract.

**Recommendation**

Remove the check, a basic authorization modifier should suffice. Or reconsider the logic in this place.

## Low Risk

### Duplicate check in DAOAccessControl initialize.
**Description**

File: DAOAccessControl.sol function initialize

45:

targets.length != function Descs.length ||

46:

targets.length != function Descs.length

Same check.

**Recommendation**

Remove the duplicate code, or replace the variable in the second check (if it was planned so)

## Informational

### Unused variable in VotesTokenWithSupply constructor.
**Description**

Votes TokenWithSupply.sol function constructor

uint256 tokenSum;

for (uint256 i $=O_{t}$ i < hodlers.length; i++) {

24:

25:

26:

27:

_mint(hodlers[i], allocations[i]);

28:

tokenSum += allocations[i];

29: }

You are processing tokenSum variable which is then not used anywhere

**Recommendation**

Remove tokenSum variable.

### Array usage in factory create functions.
**Description**

TokenFactory.sol, Treasury ModuleFactory.sol, function create

In these functions, when calling Create2.deploy, the result of the call is put into an array with one element. This is not necessary, and from a gas optimization point of view, it is slightly cheaper to accept and return a simple address type.

**Recommendation**

Replace address[1] with address.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:

The GovernorFactory (and potentially other future modules) create two contracts, and return two addresses, which is why the array is needed
https://github.com/decent-dao/fractal-module-governor/blob/main/contracts/Governor/ GovernorFactory.sol#L31-L32
Since all factories should use this same create function interface, Fractal team has decided to keep this code as is

### Unused _initFactoryBase function.
**Description**

Module FactoryBase._initFactoryBase()

This function is never used.

**Recommendation**

Remove the function.

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:

This function is actually used by both TreasuryModuleFactory.sol and the GovernorFactory.sol, and will likely be used by future module factories.

https://github.com/decent-dao/fractal-module-governor/blob/main/contracts/Governor/ GovernorFactory.sol#L17
Fractal team has decided to keep this code as is

### Check order in Timelock _beforeCall function.
**Description**

File: Timelock.sol

250: function_beforeCall(bytes32 id, bytes32 predecessor) private view {

251:

require(

252:

is Operation Ready(id),

253:

"TimelockController: operation is not ready"

254:

);

255:

256:

require(

257:

predecessor == bytes32(0) || isOperationDone(predecessor),
"TimelockController: missing dependency"

258:

);

259: }

Formally - there are not correct checks. Since it first checks "whether the task is ready", and then whether it is "completed". We understand that there will be no error in this case, since this module will be used through GovTimelock. But for independent use - it needs to be fixed.

**Recommendation**

Add a negation to the isOperation Done check

**Re-audit comment**

Verified.

From client:

After reviewing this, Fractal team believes there is no logical issue here. Note that "isOperation Ready" is being passed "id", while "isOperationDone" is being passed "predecessor".
