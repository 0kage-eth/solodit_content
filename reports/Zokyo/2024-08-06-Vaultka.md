# Findings

## High Risk

### `Position_amount` never updated after withdrawal
**Description**

The function 'request_deposit sets initiates the "PositionInfo" with `position_amount $=\emptyset$. Then, the function 'execute_deposit' updates it to be equal to received_amount right before the end of the function execution. The 'request_withdraw` uses this value to determine the amount to be withdrew and, actually does send tokens to the keeper. There's also no check if the position_info.is_in_withdraw_request is already `true`, which makes it possible to call it again many times always getting the tokens.
File: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs

**Recommendation**

re-check the logic in those four function, it seems to be totally corrupted. Try to isolate functionality and make sure to document all checks you needed

### Debt could be relieved without repayment
**Description**

the 'repay' function increases a vault_sol_balance and decreases a borrowed_amount without receiving any payments
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 614

**Recommendation**

add a Transfer function to get the payment from the borrower

## Medium Risk

### Centralized control in the program
**Description**

Both programs (strategy and vault) have centralized control. In the Strategy program, an admin account can manually specify any amount within either execute_withdraw or execute_deposit, while in the Vault program, any whitelisted account can borrow assets and repay the debt without paying assets back.

**Recommendation**

update methods to decrease centralization

### User should be both 'keeper` and 'owner` to be able to set `to_be_liquidated = true`
**Description**

In the 'request_withdraw function in the case when "dtv" is greater or equals to the "strategy.dtv_limit", there is a check for the 'accounts.user to be the strategy keeper. and right after that, on the line 913 it checks the same user to be an owner of the position
File: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 902 and 913

**Recommendation**

Make sure the owner and the keeper could be the same account for this case to work

## Low Risk

### Price multiplied by ten
**Description**

In the 'request_deposit function there are two statement: 'sol_price = sol_price* 10` and `jlp_price = jlp_price* 10', that do not make any sense.
File: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 692, 705

**Recommendation**

Please make sure if it's needed and if so, add comments to explain this adjustment.

### Duplicated check
**Description**

In the 'request_withdraw function in the case when "dtv" is less than "strategy.dtv_limit", there is a check for the 'accounts.user to be equal to `position_info.user`, but right after that it is checked again.
File: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 907 and 913

**Recommendation**

Remove duplicated check

### The event doesn't have an address
**Description**

The function 'set_whitelisted_user` fires an event Added WhitelistedUser` with only one boolean flag: "whitelisted: true" which makes no sense.
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 345

**Recommendation**

Include the whitelisted address for the event.

### The event doesn't have an address
**Description**

The function 'disable_whitelisted_user` fires an event DisabledWhitelistedUser` with only one boolean flag: "whitelisted: true" which makes no sense.
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 361

**Recommendation**

Include the whitelisted address for the event.

### unused account field
**Description**

The 'Deposit' structure defines an account 'program_authority' with an AUTHORITY_SEED', but it is never used
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 171

**Recommendation**

make sure you don't need this account in the deposit function and remove it from the structure

### use 'sub_lamports` and `add_lamports
**Description**

The anchor has functions to sub/add lamports, which are more ergonomic, performant, and have additional checks.
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 539,540,543,544,601,602

**Recommendation**

use anchor-provided functions to sub/add lamports to accounts

### Incorrect error message
**Description**

the code is checking for the 'whitelisted.whitelisted but the error thrown is Invalid BorrowAmount`
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 628

**Recommendation**

make sure the thrown errors are correct

## Informational

### Code quality issues.
**Description**

The code quality of the project is bad. The code is not well structured and the code is not well commented. Functions are overly complex and the code is not modular. The code itself is very hard to read, not self-explanatory, and hard to maintain.

**Recommendation**

Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable. Use proper naming conventions and break down the code into smaller functions.

### Unnecessary variables (`jlp_p`, `sol_p`).
**Description**

In the 'request_deposit function there are two variables introduced: 'jlp_p and 'sol_p` that are excessive.
File: strategy/programs/vaultka/src/lib.rs: 712,713

**Recommendation**

Change the declaration of initial 'jlp_price` and sol_price` as `u128` and you'll never need excessive vars.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved

### Unnecessary path prefix.
**Description**

The code uses the following constructions:
anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke , while the `anchor_lang is already imported, so it can be omitted.
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 399,425,430

**Recommendation**

omit anchor_lang` in the declaration when it has already been imported. ie: solana_program::program::invoke`

### Unsigned check for less than zero.
**Description**

The unsigned int variable could not be less than zero by the definition
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 421,502,571,618,622

**Recommendation**

compare it only for the equality, i.e.: `if deposit_amount $==0$ {`

### Unnecessary variable `utilization_rate`.
**Description**

In the 'borrow function, an excessive variable is introduced: 'utilization_rate`.
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: 712,713

**Recommendation**

Either make 'get_utilization_rate` to return Result<u64>, or use vault_data.max_utilization_rate as u128 in the comparison

### Multiple calls to the same field.
**Description**

We identified that through the entire code, there are innumerable places when the same field is accessed multiple times (i.e., "ctx.accounts.lending_account") without creating a local variable or even a local variable but in the same context, the field is being accessed for the read again
File: lending/programs/water/src/lib.rs: (numerous places)

**Recommendation**

use local variables when there are multiple reads from the same struct field
