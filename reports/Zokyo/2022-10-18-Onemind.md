# Findings

## High Risk

### ETH can get stuck on the contract.
**Description**

FeePayer.sol: function_handleMintFee(), line 24.
The returned value of call() is not checked. In case of the failed ETH transfer, there is no exception and the transaction doesn not revert. Any transferred ETH gets stuck on the contract's balance.
Also, in case the call of 'IfeeOracle(_factoryAddress).mintFeeInfo()` fails, there is no exception as well, and ETH stays on contract. Though such a case is possible only when the deployer of the contract is not CollectionFactory.sol, it might still be possible that ETH will get stuck in such a scenario.

**Recommendation**

Validate the returned value of call() to be true.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
The returned value of call() is checked now. Also, in case IfeeOracle(_factoryAddress).mintFeeInfo()` fails, it is validated that msg.value equals 0 so that no ETH gets stuck.

### Deprecated ETH transfer.
**Description**

PlatformAuction.sol: function_currency Transfer().
Due to the Istanbul update, there were several changes provided to the EVM, which made .transfer() and .send() methods deprecated for the ETH transfer. It is highly recommended to use .call() functionality with mandatory result check or the built- in functionality of the Address contract from OpenZeppelin library.

**Recommendation**

Correct ETH sending functionality with the call() function.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
The deprecated ETH transfer function was replaced with the call() function.

### Royalties might get stuck on the contract.
**Description**

PlatformAuction.sol: function_handleRoyalties(), _currency Transfer().
There is a check in the_currency Transfer() function that the 'receiver address is not zero address. In case the owner of the NFT collection has renounced the role with standard Ownable functionality, the_calculateRoyalty() function called within the_handleRoyalties() function will return zero address. This way, the royalty value will be calculated and subtracted from the initial price` (Line 150), but it won't be transferred and will get stuck on the auction contract's balance.
A similar situation can also happen in the_handleFee() function in case 'feeConfig.treasury` is set as zero address.

**Recommendation**

Do not subtract the fee value from the price in case the fee value wasn't transferred because of zero address.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
Paid 'royalty amount is now subtracted from price` in case of a successful royalty transfer. However, in_currency Transfer(), the result flag is initially equal to true. Due to this, the result of the transaction will be returned as true even though, in fact, royalty might not have been transferred.

Post-audit:
The correct result is returned now and no royalties can get stuck.

## Medium Risk

### Unchecked transfer.
**Description**

PlatformAuction.sol: function_currency Transfer().
Vault.sol: function executeTransaction().
PlatformAuction and Vault are used with regular transfer() and transferFrom() methods with no result check. The return value of an external transfer/transferFrom call is not checked, which could prevent a free deposit/money loss for the user. In this case, it is better to use SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin. SafeERC20 has a built-in mandatory checks on any transfer, including non-standard implementations of ERC20 tokens (e.g., USDT token).

**Recommendation**

Use SafeERC20 library.

## Low Risk

### Parameters lack validation.
**Description**

NFTCollectionERC721.sol: function mintNFT(), update TokenURI().
NFTCollectionERC1155.sol: function mintNFT(), update TokenURI().
PlatformAuction.sol: constructor().
StandardBid.sol: constructor(), updateConfig().
Vault.sol: constructor().
Function parameters should be validated before setting them in storage.
1) NFTCollectionERC721.sol:
The 'recipient parameter should be validated not to be zero address. The 'newURI' parameter should be validated not to be an empty string. The royalty Fraction parameter should be validated not to exceed 10000`. (Divider from line 32 for ERC721 and line 56 for ERC1155).
2) NFTCollection ERC1155.sol:
all the previous parameters should be validated as well. Additionally, in the mintNFT() function, the amount parameter should be validated in order to be greater than 0.
3) PlatformAuction.sol:
The 'feeConfig_.nominator parameter should be validated not to exceed `10000` (Divider from line 119). The 'feeConfig_.treasury parameter should be validated not to be equal to zero address.
4) StandardBid.sol:
The 'config_.initialPrice parameter should be validated in order to be less than config_.minimalPrice`. Both variables should be validated not be equal to 0. The config_.auctionDuration parameter should be validated in order to be greater than 0. The 'config_.buyNowPercent parameter should be validated in order to be greater than 10000 (a divider in line 127).
5) Vault.sol:
The currency_` parameter should be validated in order not to be equal to zero address.

**Recommendation**

Validate function parameters.

### Config parameters are not validated.
**Description**

DutchBid.sol: function updateConfig().
Values from the 'config' parameter are not validated in a way they are validated in the constructor (Line 25). In this case, the owner can set values in a way that the price will go below zero.

**Recommendation**

Verify config_` values like in the constructor.

## Informational

### Maintainers.sol contract can be left without maintainers.
**Description**

Maintainers.sol: function remove Maintainer(). Users with the maintainer role can remove other maintainers, including themselves. In this case, a malicious maintainer can remove all other maintainers and leave the contract without users with such a role. The issue is marked as informational since initially the deployer of the contract is assigned the maintainer role and should grant this role only to validated addresses.

**Recommendation**

Verify that the contract can't be left without maintainers.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
The validation was added. Now, the maintainer can't remove other mainteiners.

### Owner can set URI for non-existing token.
**Description**

NFTCollectionERC721.sol, NFTCollectionERC1155.sol: function updateTokenURI(). It is not validated if the provided 'tokenId exists, thus, the owner can modify non-exisiting tokens. The issue is marked as low since URI for non-existing tokens is overridden during the creation of the NFT token.

**Recommendation**

Verify that the provided 'tokenId exists.

### Use of magic number instead of storage constant.
**Description**

NFTCollectionERC721.sol: function royaltyInfo(), line 32.
NFTCollectionERC1155.sol: function royaltyInfo(), line 56.
PlatformAuction.sol: function_calculateFee(), line 118.
StandardBid.sol: function buy NowPrice(), line 127.
In order to increase the readability of the contract's code, the value '10000` should be moved to the storage constant.

**Recommendation**

Use storage constant.

### Auctions can be created with any ERC721/ERC1155 contracts via AuctionFactory.
**Description**

AuctionFactory.sol
There are no restrictions for selling NFT contracts on the platform. Thus, malicious NFT contracts can be created and used by malefactors. The issue is marked as informational in case this is an intended functionality to trade any NFTs, not only the ones created through CollectionFactory.sol. Nevertheless, such functionality should be mentioned in report.

**Recommendation**

Add a whitelist of NFTs that can be traded or verify that any NFT might be sold.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
According to the OneMind team, it is an intended behavior. Any NFTs that were created not by CollectionFactory will not be listed and displayed on the platform.

### Potential Denial-of-Service in StandardBid refund mechanism.
**Description**

StandardBid.sol
The contract performs a refund of ETH funds (in case the contract currency is ETH) in all core functions of the contract. In case 'currentWinner is a malicious contract, it could prevent refunding with malicious code in its receive() function. Currently, the issue is marked as informational since the send() function is used to transfer ETH, which doesn't revert on failure. However, such an approach is not considered to be correct. Which is why, it is recommended to refund funds separately from core functions.

**Recommendation**

Refund funds aside from core functions.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
It is validated that in case a refund fails, the transaction is not reverted and tokens can be withdrawn later.

### Vault transactions are not time-limited.
**Description**

Vault.sol
Usually, transactions in multi-sig contracts have a deadline, after which the transaction can't be executed. This is done to mitigate the situation when a part of owners iscompromised. For Vault.sol, such an issue is marked as informational since all the owners have to confirm the transaction before it can be executed.

**Recommendation**

Add a deadline for transactions or verify that such logic is not necessary.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
All transactions have an expiration timestamp now.

### Vault transaction initiator needs to explicitly confirm.
**Description**

Vault.sol: function submit Transaction(). Usually, in multi-sig contracts, submitting a transaction means that msg.sender also confirms it. Currently, in order to confirm a transaction, the owner has to execute one more function. In order to reduce gas spendings for the owner, it is recommended to mark that he confirmed transactions during submitting.

**Recommendation**

Mark that msg.sender who calls submit Transaction() confirms it or verify that such logic is not desired for the contract.

**Re-audit comment**

Resolved.

Post-audit:
Transactions are automatically confirmed by the owner who has submitted them.
